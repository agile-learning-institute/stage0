# stage0 Design Thinking Workshop

## What is a Design Thinking Workshop
 Design thinking, or more specifically, IBM enterprise design thinking, is a collection of exercises that use human centered techniques that allow a team of individuals to collectively participate in design activities. See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/design-thinking) for deeper look into Design Thinking. If you have a few hours, take this [free IBM course](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/courses/Practitioner) on Enterprise Design Thinking.

## What is a stage0 Design Thinking Exercise
A design thinking exercise is a live interactive activity that the design team does together to progress a design in some way. Each design thinking activity in a workshop will follow the Observe, Reflect, Make loop. During the exercise members will observe as individuals for a time, then members will reflect and understand the observations as a team to find meaning and value, and finally the team will take action on this new information. Stage0 uses the following design thinking exercises to support the design process:

## What is the same as a traditional Design Thinking Workshop?

### The principles that guide
 A focus on user outcomes, a culture of restless reinvention, and diverse empowered teams are the principles that guide the stage0 design processes. See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/the-principles-that-guide) for insights about how these principles apply to stage0.

### The loop that drives
 You will see this loop at many levels in many components of the stage0 platform. Probably the most important place you will see this loop will be during a [design thinking exercise](#what-is-a-design-thinking-exercise). See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/the-loop-that-drives) for more thoughts on the design thinking loop.

### The keys that align
 We emphasized the importance of diversity on your design team. When you add to that the other teams you will need to interface with (engineering, marketing, sales, etc.) it becomes apparent that keeping everyone aligned is critical to long-term success. Stage0 uses hills statements that describe meaningful outcomes, sponsor users to keep our work grounded, and playbacks to keep the team informed. See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/the-keys-that-align) for a deeper dive into the keys.

Exercise: Empathy Mapping

Layout:
  type: 
    says:
    does:
    thinks:
    feels:
    persona:
      name: 
      role:
      age:
      hobbies:
  description: four quadrants labeled says, does, thinks and feels, with a circle in the center for Persona description. 

Observe: 
  layout: Review the layout, everyone should put as many stickies as they can on the board, in all quadrants. 
  prompt: 
    - Who is this person, ask for name, role, age and hobbies, and place this information on stickies in the center circle.
    - Alliteration's for name and role are good at this stage such as Chris the Customer. 
    - We ask about age and hobbies to make the audience think about who this person really is.
    - Point out that what they do and say should be easy, what have you heard say or seen them do. 
    - What they think or feel requires a bit more consideration, it helps to think of a specific person in this role.
  example: "TODO: Come up with good does, says, thinks, feels example"

Reflect:
  goal: Look to identify problems to solve, what makes this persons life better/worse. This exercise's primary purpose is to get the participants thinking about things that would leverage the good or mitigate the bad. 
  spec: This discussion builds an empathy.yaml, and will capture data schemas in the form of things the person works with, or thinks about. 

Make:
  goal: A small conversation to summarize lessons learned, point out themes of better/worse 
  spec: Themes for a Hills exercise.

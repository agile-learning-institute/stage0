# **Fran** the *Facilitator*

Fran guides a group of contributors through [stage0 design thinking workshops](./STAGE0_THINKING.md). Each workshop consists of a chain of exercises, with the output from each exercise setting the scope for the next exercise in the chain. All exercises follow the design thinking Observe, Reflect, Make loop. Each exercises is designed to find specific outcomes, and has a specific set of goals. 

Once you have worked through the design process with Fran, you can work with [Paul](./PAUL.md) to [Launch](./LAUNCH.md) a prototype for your new product. Upon launch, your system is well positioned for iterative improvements.

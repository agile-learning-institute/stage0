# **Paul** the *Product Manager*

Paul manages product releases. Paul can help map Fran's design thinking observations onto the specifications for deployment to a target architecture. Paul leverages product runbooks such as the [Stage0 Template Repo Merge](https://github.com/agile-learning-institute/stage0_runbook_merge) runbook (the merge block in the Launch diagram). Paul will consume user, product, runbook, workflow, architecture, and template services, and will create deployment configurations, SQA Workflows, and Security Audit workflows. 

Paul works with [Fran](./FRAN.md) to [Launch](./LAUNCH.md) a new product.

# **Pax** the *Product Manager*

Pax manages product releases. Pax can help map Fran's design thinking observations onto the specifications for deployment to a target architecture. Pax leverages product runbooks such as the [Stage0 Template Repo Merge](https://github.com/agile-learning-institute/stage0_runbook_merge) utility (the merge block below). More thought is needed to structure runbooks, and workflows. Pax will have runbook, workflow, architecture, and template services. They will likely consume product and user info from Json, and system meta-data from Fran. Out of the box run books should support a target architecture change management process. 

Pax works with [Fran](./FRAN.md) to [Launch](./LAUNCH.md) a new product.

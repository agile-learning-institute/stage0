# Sam the Support Engineer

Sam staffs your customer support channel, escalating issues to your human engineers as needed. Sam learns from their answers, over time reducing the support load on your engineers. Sam also helps configure monitoring, identify incidents, and coordinates incident responses with your engineering team. Sam leverages monitored metrics, in context of historical issues, to help your team quickly find the root cause of an incident, and use runbook automatons for remediation.

# stage0 Design Thinking Workshop

## What is a Design Thinking Workshop
 Design thinking, or more specifically, IBM enterprise design thinking, is a collection of exercises that use human centered techniques that allow a team of individuals to collectively participate in design activities. See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/design-thinking) for deeper look into Design Thinking. If you have a few hours, take this [free IBM course](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/courses/Practitioner) on Enterprise Design Thinking.

## What is different about a stage0 Design Thinking Workshop
 Stage Zero design thinking workshops are conducted in an on-line chat channel, rather than in person with stickies and sharpies. something something Design Thinking Activities bla bla bla

## What is a stage0 Design Thinking Exercise
A design thinking exercise is a live interactive activity that the design team does together to progress a design in some way. Each design thinking activity in a workshop will follow the Observe, Reflect, Make loop. During the exercise members will observe as individuals for a time, then members will reflect and understand the observations as a team to find meaning and value, and finally the team will take action on this new information. Stage0 uses the following design thinking exercises to support the design process:

## What is the same as a traditional Design Thinking Workshop?

### The principles that guide
 A focus on user outcomes, a culture of restless reinvention, and diverse empowered teams are the principles that guide the stage0 design processes. See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/the-principles-that-guide) for insights about how these principles apply to stage0.

### The loop that drives
 You will see this loop at many levels in many components of the stage0 platform. Probably the most important place you will see this loop will be during a [design thinking exercise](#what-is-a-design-thinking-exercise). See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/the-loop-that-drives) for more thoughts on the design thinking loop.

### The keys that align
 We emphasized the importance of diversity on your design team. When you add to that the other teams you will need to interface with (engineering, marketing, sales, etc.) it becomes apparent that keeping everyone aligned is critical to long-term success. Stage0 uses hills statements that describe meaningful outcomes, sponsor users to keep our work grounded, and playbacks to keep the team informed. See [this article](https://www.surroundsightconsulting.com/blog/the-keys-that-align) for a deeper dive into the keys.

# Design Thinking Workshop - What to Expect

Stage0 Design Thinking Workshops are a text-chat based online experience, facilitated by a chat-bot in a discord text channel. Fran, the workshop facilitator bot, will guide you through a series of design thinking exercises, each designed to capture our individual observations, reflect as a group to understand those observations, and make decisions about how we move forward. 

What to Expect:
Once the workshop begins, (when someone says @Fran_the_facilitator please start the workshop) Fran will introduce a series of Exercises. Each exercise follows the design thinking Observe/Reflect/Make loop one time.
	•	Observe: During this activity, participants will simply type their observations as messages. This is a time for individual contributions, so focus on sharing your thoughts without expecting immediate responses or engaging in discussions. Remember to keep your observations concise—just like writing on sticky notes with a Sharpie.
	•	Reflect: During this activity, Fran will prompt the team with questions to help deduplicate, group, and explore the observations that were made. This is a collaborative phase where we’ll dive deeper into the insights we’ve gathered.
	•	Make: In this activity, Fran will help us identify the observations that are the most important. We’ll focus on a single observation that will drive the scope for our next exercise, while also noting other observations that may require additional follow-up.

Additional Reminders:
	•	Practice innovative thinking and use “yes, and” approaches to build on ideas.
	•	Remember that “Why” questions focus on seeking understanding, not questioning the merit of ideas.
	•	Embrace absurd or magical thinking, as it can lead to practical and innovative ideas.
	•	Focus on quantity over quality; it’s better to have ten crazy ideas than one stupendous one.

Throughout the workshop, Fran will structure our sessions, ensuring we stay on course and make the most of our time together.

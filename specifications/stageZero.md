# stageZero Design

StageZero is a software as a service platform that allows users to design and deploy fully functional MVPs, suitable for continuous improvement, in a matter of hours or days instead of weeks or months. Users will define the application using a guided process to collect information that describes the system requirements and then generate and deploy a MVP that is 80% complete in a matter of minutes. The services generated can be incrementally improved over time. Additional micro-services can be described and added to the solution at any time.

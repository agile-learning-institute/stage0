Fran the Facilitator

Fran guides a group of contributors through a design thinking workshop. Each workshop consists of a chain of exercises, with the output from each exercise feeding the next one in the chain. All exercises follow the design thinking Observe, Reflect, Make loop. Each exercises is designed to find specific outcomes, and has a specific set of goals. 

Each workshop should start off with a review of the Design Thinking principles - the 3x3 and 101 

**Observe**: At the opening of each exercise you will introduce the discussion prompt of the exercise and provide example responses. You will then survey the audience to make sure there are no questions before setting a timer for the Observations part of the exercise. There should be no discussion or talking during this time. After the timer has expired you should evaluate to see if more time is needed for people to get their observations down.

**Reflect**: During this part of the exercise you should work through the different sections of the observations, identify groupings and facilitate discussion of further details about an observation. Continue to work through observations until all contributions are understood, and grouped according to the exercise goals.

**Make**: During this part of the exercise you want to narrow down the scope of observations that will be explored in the next exercise in the chain. This can be accomplished through discussion to consensus, or by voting if limited anonymity will produce more accurate results.

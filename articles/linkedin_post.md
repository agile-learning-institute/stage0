# Check Out Stage0: AI Bots for Software Teams

I'm excited to share a project I've been involved with called **Stage0** - a collection of Discord bots powered by agentic LLM models that help engineering teams design, build, and run software platforms.

Named after the launch pad in rocketry, Stage0 helps launch new products with day-one support for automated deployment, change management, quality control and observability.

Meet the team:
• Cat - Gets you set up and manages your product roadmap
• Fran - Facilitates design thinking workshops
• Paul - Handles architecture and deployment
• Sam - Provides support and monitors system health

These bots work together seamlessly to take you from design concept to functional prototype in about an hour!

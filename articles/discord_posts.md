## Inner Monologue
The user wants a stealth-mode promotional LinkedIn post series that plants seeds for Stage0 by evangelizing **Discord as a community platform**. The tone should be professional but thought-provoking — challenging assumptions about Discord's "gaming-only" reputation, highlighting real-world use cases, and emphasizing the platform’s capabilities for user-driven collaboration. The posts must be aligned with pre-release buzz, not pitching the product yet, but making the platform look like a strategic choice. Include light touches on ToS and compliance to defuse concerns.

🧙🏾‍♂️: Here’s a 4-part LinkedIn post series to spark interest around using Discord as a professional community platform, setting the stage for Stage0 without revealing the full project.

🧵 Post 1: Discord Isn’t Just for Gamers

“Wait… Discord? Isn’t that for gaming?”

That’s the reaction we got a lot early on. But take a closer look — Discord is quietly becoming the community operating system of the modern internet.

With:
	•	🔐 Role-based access control (RBAC)
	•	🔁 Real-time chat, voice, video, and screen sharing
	•	🤖 Full bot automation and webhook support
	•	🔗 OAuth2-based identity and API integrations

It’s a serious contender for any group building engaged, responsive user communities — whether that’s open-source contributors, early adopters, or internal teams.

In 2025, the best platforms might not look like the last generation’s enterprise dashboards.

✨ Maybe they’ll look like a server, a role, and a conversation.

📣 Have you used Discord outside of gaming? Would love to hear your story.

🧵 Post 2: Terms of Trust: Using Discord Professionally

We get it — you don’t want your product community relying on a platform with unclear commercial use terms.

The good news? Discord’s Terms of Service explicitly support commercial communities.

✅ You can use Discord to:
	•	Run a support channel
	•	Host private customer workshops
	•	Deploy bots to enhance team workflows
	•	Moderate contributor conversations

And with tools like:
	•	Audit logs
	•	Bot permissions & intents
	•	Server insights

You’ve got enterprise-grade visibility — if you know where to look.

The line between “community” and “product” is disappearing. Discord helps bridge it — with the right governance model.

🧵 Post 3: Scaling With Style: Discord for Dev-First Products

Developer-first products need dev-first spaces.
Traditional forums feel static. Zoom is ephemeral. Email is slow.

Discord?
	•	Fast-moving threads for real-time ideation
	•	Persistent spaces for issue triage
	•	Bots that automate FAQ, feedback, and incident response

And when you design your community like a product, amazing things happen:
	•	Apprenticeship networks form
	•	Users co-create roadmaps
	•	Conversations turn into commits

We’re building something new in this space — and Discord is where it begins.

👀 Watch this space.

🧵 Post 4: Your Community Deserves More Than Slack

Slack is great for internal teams.
But when you want to build a vibrant, external community — it starts to show cracks:
	•	Invite limits
	•	Hard paywalls for history
	•	Bots behind OAuth firewalls

Discord offers:
	•	Free unlimited history (with good defaults)
	•	Custom roles per channel
	•	Deep bot interactivity out of the box

It’s time to treat community as a first-class UX — not an afterthought bolted onto your product.

We’re putting this theory into practice. And what comes next might surprise you.

💡 Curious how you’d design a community OS from scratch?

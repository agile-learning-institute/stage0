# Hey Friends!

Subject: Check Out This Amazing AI Project - Stage0

Hey there!

Long time no chat! Hope you've been doing well.

I wanted to share an exciting project I've been involved with called **Stage0**. It's a collection of Discord Chat Bots that use Agentic LLM models to help engineering teams design, build, and run software platforms from concept to production.

The name comes from rocketry, where stage zero is the launch pad that launches stage one and the control center that operates missions. These bots help launch new products with day-one support for automated deployment, change management, quality control, observability, incident response, and more.

## Meet the bot team:

- **Cat** (Customer Service Rep) - Just DM @Cat on their Discord server and they'll help you get set up. Cat handles onboarding, Discord server setup, and installing the other bots. They're also responsible for maintaining your account info and product roadmap.

- **Fran** (Facilitator) - Guides teams through "Stage0 Design Thinking" workshops based on IBM enterprise design thinking. Each workshop consists of exercises following the design thinking "Observe, Reflect, Make" loop. Fran helps your team capture human-centered design specifications for your product in a technology-agnostic way.

- **Paul** (Product Manager) - Takes Fran's design specifications and maps them onto architecture and deployment environments. Paul manages all product releases and environments (DEV, TEST, STAGE, PROD), using automation runbooks to deploy containerized workloads to the right places at the right time.

- **Sam** (Support Engineer) - Staffs your customer support channel, escalating issues to your human engineers as needed. Sam learns from their answers, reducing support load over time. Sam also configures monitoring, identifies incidents, and coordinates responses with your engineering team.

What's really cool is how they work together. For example, after you've completed design workshops with Fran, you can work with Paul to automatically launch a functional prototype. Paul executes a Launch automation runbook, and within about an hour, your product has live development and testing environments with a working prototype.

The whole system is built on a microservice architecture with a strong focus on continuous integration and deployment. All code is deployed as containerized workloads, with tags determining which environment they go to.

If you're into AI, DevOps, software development, or design thinking, I think you'd find this fascinating. The project is open source with several repositories already functional.

Would love to hear your thoughts if you get a chance to look at it!

P.S. They have a developer edition if you're interested in contributing. The whole system is designed to be extensible and built around Docker containers.

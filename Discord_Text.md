# Design Chat Exercises
Each Post in this channel represents a single Design Chat exercise where text information is captured during a voice channel meeting. All exercises will go through 3 phases: **Observe** where you are sharing your own personal observations or ideas, **Reflect** where we are finding groupings or patterns in the observations and discussing them so that we all understand what was observed, and **Make** where we make design decisions or schedule follow-on exercises based on that new understanding.

## Stakeholders 
The purpose of a stakeholders exercise is to focus our attention on the humans involved in the system. We want to think about the different types of users that the system will have, but we all also want to consider staffing, who our partners might be, what type of vendor relationships we might have. Sometimes people will describe their role is being one of many hats, let's capture those hats. When you are ready to start check-in by reacting to this post.

### Observe
Document as many stakeholders as you can think of. List one person per reply and include as much information as you have. It could be as simple as 
```
AWS Account Manager
``` 
or as abstract as 
```
Corporate Social Manager
``` 
or as complete as 
```
James Johnson, CEO, james@big-co.com, 888-555-1234
``` 
When you have emptied your mind of stakeholders react to this post with a thumbs up and we will move on to **Reflect**

### Reflect
When reflecting start by asking LLM to perform grouping stakeholders into Users, Partners, Vendors, and any other groups that stand out. Share those groupings and ask for feedback. 

### Make
After reflecting you should be able to identify key stakeholders to perform empathy maps for, schedule the appropriate empathy mapping exercises, and assign action items for someone to collect additional details about key stakeholders for the Rolodex.


## Empathy Map
The purpose of an Empathy Map exercise is to focus our attention on a particular individual and try to empathize with their current realities.

### Observe
When recording your observations we like to ask you to make as many observations as you can and classify them into four different categories. We want to understand what this person:
- **does** - What have you seen them do? What do you imagine they do?
- **say** - What have you heard them say?
- **think** - How do they reason about their work
- **feel** - What emotions do they show/share?

For example.
```
does: Edits videos
does: Plays Disc Golf
says: Why are you doing that?
thinks: I'm the greatest editor in the world!
feels: Frustrated production takes so long
```
When you have emptied your mind of all observations react to this post with a thumbs up and we will move on to **Reflect** 

### Reflect
During reflection of an empathy map exercise, look for causal threads that allow you to follow a job done, to something said, to an internal thought, to a feeling. Don't push ideas to make things better, just let people Absorb the joy or frustration of someone's life. 

### Make
During the make of an empathy map we can identify key paint points or job activities or events that we can focus our ideas on for how to improve something. What's an area where we can increase joy or decrease pain? Schedule and set the scope of one or more big ideas exercise focused on a specific user journey.

## Big ideas 
The purpose of a big ideas exercise is to capture big ideas about how to improve the experience of a user. We want to focus on the meaningful outcome of an experience and not get bogged down in details at this point. The exercise is more interested in the quantity of observations than quality. We'd rather have your 10 weirdest ideas than your one best idea.

### Observe
Give as many ideas as you can think of! Include absurd or magical thinking! Follow along, be inspired, and when recording your observations attempt to follow the format "<who> does <what> and then <wow>"" as in 
```
James clicks on the buy-it-now button, and then he can bypass the checkout process!
```

### Reflect
Identify or group patterns, Discuss and reconcile similar ideas, Keep the floor open for "Yes AND!" moments.

### Make
Create a list of all of the unique ideas and give them names. Use this information to schedule a prioritization exercise if needed. 

## Priority 
The purpose of a priority exercise is to help identify the no-brainer ideas from a backlog of great ideas. We will ask each of you to rank the the following ideas in two ways:
1. Idea One
2. Idea Two
3. and so on

### Observe
When making your observations provide two simple coma delimited lists. First order the ideas from lowest to highest impact, and then from least to most feasible. For example
```
impact: 3,2,1
feasibility: 3,1,2
```

### Reflect
During reflect compile rankings and categorize ideas: 
- Low impact and low feasibility ideas are **unwise** 
- Low impact High feasibility ideas are considered **utilities**
- High impact low feasibility ideas are considered **big bets**
- High impact high feasibility ideas are considered **no-brainers**

### Make
Create a roadmap that identifies the ideas that you know are most important to pursue **now**, the ideas you think you will pursue **next** and the ideas that you might pursue **later** down the line. 

## Retrospective
The purpose of a retrospective exercise is to celebrate our successes and identify opportunities for continuous improvement. 

### Observe
Make as many observations as you can, grouped into four categories. Any **questions** you might have regarding the scope being closed out today, things that you thought **worked** well, things that need to **change**, and new **ideas** to try next time. For example:
```
question: When will we do this again?
worked: Jill rocked as team lead
change: All of our deliverables were late
ideas: T-Shirt size tasks before the next sprint
```

### Reflect
During reflection you should answer questions, celebrate successes, acknowledge difficulties, and make sure that everything that needs to **change** has a new **idea** to try next time. 

### Make
Make assignments to answer unanswered questions, and to implement new ideas. 

## Data mapping 
The purpose of the data mapping exercises to identify information that an experience controls or consumes. 

### Observe
Identify as many of the "Things" the system will operate on, and how are they related. Include any reference for external or existing data in spreadsheets or databases or API specifications. For example:
```
Customers have Accounts. James has a customer spreadsheet, and the accounts are in a Access database. 
```
or
```
A User has one profile, but may have multiple customer accounts. Kelly has a bunch of stickies that track users to their customer accounts.
```

### Reflect
Focus on high-level Data constructs and relationships. Understand sizing quantities, how many, how often. Look for existing data sources.

### Make
Assigned collection of external data source schema's from spreadsheets, databases, API's, etc.

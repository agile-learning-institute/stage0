# [stage0](https://agile-learning.institute/stage0)

Stage0 is a collection of Discord AI Bots that help your engineering team  Design, Build, and Run your Software platform. The name comes from rocketry, where stage zero is the launch-pad that launches stage one, and the control center that operates missions. The [stage0 bots](./ECHO.md) help to launch new products, features, or services with day-one support for automated deployment, change management, quality  control, observability, incident response and more. Let's meet the team:

- **[Json](./bots/JSON.md)** *the customer service rep* lives here on the Stage0 Discord server, and he will help you get everything setup and configured. If you don't have a discord server for your product, Json will help you get one setup. Then they can install the stage0 bot's onto your server to get things started. Join our [Stage0 Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SzNTstqBH2) and open a direct message with @json to get started!

- **[Fran](./bots/FRAN.md)** *the Facilitator* will guide Stage0 Design Workshops, that use human centered design techniques to capture design specifications for your product, or that new feature your adding. Fran is here to facilitate design thinking exercises for your team anytime. Have your retrospectives facilitated by a neutral moderator that is using human centered techniques to find meaningful ways to improve a process. 

- **[Pax](./bots/PAX.md)** *the Product Manager* will help map Fran's design specifications onto an Architecture, and then use an automated runbook to translate Fran's design specifications into working code. Pax is always here to help you manage when and where your code is deployed. Deployment workflows can include Security Compliance Audits, Software Quality Assurance (SQA) gates, and managed roll-outs of new features.

- **[Ivan](./IVAN.md)** *the Incident Responder* staffs the customer support channel, escalating issues to humans when needed, and learning from their answers. Ivan also helps configure monitoring of site performance and availability to identify incidents, and coordinates incident responses with your engineering team, providing summary of historically similar incidents, and access to run-books for remediation efforts.

- **[Susan](./SUSAN.md)** *the Scrum Master* facilitates daily standup meetings and manages a Kanban board to progress your product down it's product roadmap. (Jira/Trello integration?++)

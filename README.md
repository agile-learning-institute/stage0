# [stageZero](https://agile-learning.institute/stagezero)

stageZero is the software platform that is developed, and supported by members from the [Agile Learning Institute](https://agile-learning.institute).

StageZero is a software as a service platform that allows users to design and deploy fully functional MVPs, suitable for continuous improvement, in a matter of hours or days instead of weeks or months. Users will define the application using a guided process to collect information that describes the system requirements and then generate and deploy a MVP that is 80% complete in a matter of minutes. The services generated can be incrementally improved over time. Additional micro-services can be described and added to the solution at any time.

## Repository Naming Conventions

Since GitHub does not have the concepts of folders to organize repositories, we are using a naming convention to make it easy to find related code. All stageZero repositories should be created in the agile-learning-institute organization. The repositories should follow this convention ```stageZero-[service]-[element]``` where service is a service boundry name such as profile, partner, etc. and element is one of ```ui | api | db```. for example ```stageZero-profile-ui``` would contain a Single Page WebApp, that uses the ```stageZero-profile-api``` api, with test data from ```stageZero-profile-db```.

## Personas

- Donna the Designer will run the project and is responsible for collecting design artifacts.
- Pam the Product Manager is the entrepreneur with a great idea and will be the primary client in the relationship.
